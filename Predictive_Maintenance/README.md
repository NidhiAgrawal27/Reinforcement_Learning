# About

This repository contains the source code for applying reinforcement learning for 'Predictive Maintenance for Machines'.

## Objective: 

Use Reinforcement Learning to predict and schedule maintenance for lab instruments to avoid downtime.

Environment: Laboratory equipment with sensors monitoring usage and wear.
State: Current machine condition (e.g., usage time, error rates).
Actions: Schedule maintenance or continue operation.
Rewards:
- Positive: Machine is operational.
- Negative: Unnecessary maintenance or equipment breakdowns.

## Data: Generate data for training and testing
